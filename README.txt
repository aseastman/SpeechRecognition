This repository is for speech recognition projects and code. It uses the dragonfly framework and Windows Speech Recognition.

ProvidedExample.py
- This is essentially just a copy of the example that is provided on the dragonfly repository. There is an addition that keeps the program running so that the speech recognition can check and run the rule that is uploaded.

SimpleMicCheck.py
- This is a modification of an example that can be expanded later. For now, it simply writes the text that you say.
